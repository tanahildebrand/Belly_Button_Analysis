# Belly Button Analysis

For this project, we created a webpage which summarizes data from a Belly Button Biodiversity project. The data is displayed per anonymous participant ID into three graphs:
1) Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
2) Belly Button Washing Frequency - Scrubs per Week
3) Bacteria Cultures Per Sample

The dashboard can be found here: https://tanahildebrand.github.io/Belly_Button_Analysis/
